    </div>
    <div class="blog-body">
        A javascript game where the objective is to consume other bubbles and expand your radius. You loose health at the same time so there's a chance a health pack will appear! Note: there are bugs where the collision between health packs don't work and others. If the game stops and it doesn't say you die, you've won! (Just haven't had time to change it.)
